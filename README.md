# South-Side-Housing-Data-Initiative

This repo contains work on the South Side Housing Data Initiative through the Harris School of Public Policy.
I visualize the distribution of federal affordable housing programs (Housing Choice Vouchers(HCV) and Project-Based Section 8(PBS8)) on different administrative and geographic levels in Chicago based on data from HUD. 
I also visualize the distribution, sizes, expiration dates of buildings under the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit(LIHTC) program. The map shows the distribution of LIHTC in a region on the South Side of Chicago and the impact of these expiring properties on the population living in those buildings.
The Cityscape dataset contains all taxed properties in one of the communities, South Shore. This dataset allows me to match addresses of properties owner with the location of the properties. The result of the matching allows me to see how many properties are owned by outside investors (either mom-and-pop owners or large real estate owners) that do not live in South Shore.
